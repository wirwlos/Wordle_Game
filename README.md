#Wordle_Game
I was inspired by the NYtimes Wordle game and created this mini game. The game is currently limited to 100 words in data.js, but I may add more in the future.

#How to Play
To play the game, type any combination of letters into the input area. If a letter exists in the chosen word but in a different spot, the letter will turn yellow. If the letter is in the correct spot, it will turn green. Keep guessing until you find the word!

You can give any input you wish, as there is no dictionary to check against. If you find the word, simply click on the "New Game" button to start a new round.

#Features
The Wordle game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, it only offers the basic game functionality, but in the future, I plan to add a "winning" celebration and a "statistics" screen to show the user's progress.

#Known Issues
At the moment, there are no known bugs or issues with the game. However, as the game is limited to 100 words, users may notice repetition in the words after playing for some time.
